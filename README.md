# Stationeers Inventory Tweaks

# Description

This mod is designed to improve the inventory management aspect of Stationeers.

Current features include:
* Combine items into existing stacks when moving via double click
* Add keybind for hitting "Next" on your current active item (for example, the Advanced Tablet)
* Fixes weird gaps between inventory windows

# Installation

* If you don't have BepInEx installed, download the lastest 5.x 64 bit version available at https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases and follow the [BepInEx installation instructions](https://docs.bepinex.dev/v5.4.21/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) to install.
     - Simplified instructions: Extract into your Stationeers folder where the rocketstation.exe file is located.
     - Start the game once to finish installing BepInEx and verify that the plugins folder was created in \Stationeers\BepInEx\plugins. If so, the BepInEx installation is completed.
* Download the lastest release from https://github.com/theit8514/Stationeers-InventoryTweaks/releases/ page.
* Unpack it inside the folder \Stationeers\BepInEx\plugins
* Start the game.

# Usage

The mod adds a new keybind to hit the "Next" button on your current active item. The default is the 'Z' key. It can be changed from the Controls page.

# Future Plans

Some fixes planned for the future:
* When dragging items from inventory to hand, the slot that item came from is not tracked. Moving that item back will pick a new inventory slot.

Thoughts on additional features:
* Add refill hand from inventory on construction/placement and sort items to inventory on deconstruction.
* Configuration options to disable/enable certain features.
